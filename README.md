# Feed Reader Testing

## Overview

A web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

This application includes [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) testing.

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

## Quickstart

To run this application you can download the zip or clone the directory to your computer.

Then, open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
